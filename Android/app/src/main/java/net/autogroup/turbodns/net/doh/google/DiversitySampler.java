/**
 * Given a collection of IP addresses (all the same family), produce a random sample that is
 * diverse, i.e. samples are spread widely across the input as measured by the Hamming distance.
 * Low Hamming distance is taken as an indication of correlated failure.  In the most significant
 * bits, this would happen if an entire subnet become unusable.  In the least significant bits, this
 * would indicate a change to a configuration that is replicated across many subnets.
