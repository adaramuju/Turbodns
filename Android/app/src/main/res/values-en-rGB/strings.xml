  <string name="intro_benefit_body">Turbo DNS protects you from DNS manipulation, a cyber attack used to block access to news sites, social media platforms and messaging apps.\n\nWhile Turbo DNS protects you against DNS manipulation, there are other more complicated blocking techniques and attacks that Turbo DNS doesn\'t protect against.</string>
